 README

   Email Trek is derived from the concept of Star Trek, we assume that the
   email system is destroyed (more exactly and loss associated with human).

   We construct a system can be randomly generated email, and will
   automatically send mail, through this email we will get four state:

     ▞▚ Delivery    ▒▒ Sent    ▓▓ Failure  ██ Open

   We construct a system can be randomly generated email, and will
   automatically send mail, through this email we will get four kinds of
   state: we will record these states, drawing into our own star coordinates.
